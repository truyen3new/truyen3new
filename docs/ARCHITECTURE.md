# Light Story Architecture Standard

## Purpose

This is the canonical repository-wide reference for how Light Story code is organized and how new work should be introduced.

## Layering Rules

- Dependencies point inward only.
- Domain code contains business rules and pure types.
- Application code orchestrates use cases, DTOs, and validation.
- Infrastructure code adapts external systems behind interfaces.
- Presentation code handles transport, routing, and response shaping only.

## Repository Layout

### Frontend

- `frontend/src/shared/core` holds base abstractions such as `BaseService`, `BaseRepository`, `DomainError`, `GlobalExceptionHandler`, `Logger`, and `Result`.
- `frontend/src/domain` contains entities and repository interfaces.
- `frontend/src/application` contains DTOs and use cases.
- `frontend/src/infrastructure` contains Supabase adapters and other external integrations.
- `frontend/src/presentation` and `frontend/src/app` handle UI and API entry points.
- `frontend/src/services/analytics.service.ts` reads `CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_WORKER_URL` for infrastructure analytics data and must stay browser-safe.

### Backend D1 SaaS

- `backend-d1-saas/src/shared/core` holds shared runtime utilities, error handling, logging, and result helpers.
- `backend-d1-saas/src` organizes worker handlers, provisioning flows, and tenant operations.

### Backend Supabase

- `backend-supabase/supabase/functions` contains deployed function handlers and their shared helpers.
- `backend-supabase/supabase/migrations` owns schema changes.
- `backend-supabase/docs` captures database and policy notes.
- `backend-supabase/workers/analytics-aggregator.ts` is the Cloudflare Worker that powers the analytics dashboard's infrastructure metrics endpoint.

### Comic Platform (New)

- **Migration**: `backend-supabase/supabase/migrations/202605100001_comic_platform.sql`
  - Core schema: `stories`, `chapters` with pgvector embeddings (1536-dim)
  - RLS policies: `read_published_stories`, `read_free_chapters`, `read_vip_chapters_premium_admin`
  - Search RPC: `search_stories(query_embedding, match_count)`
  - Index: `idx_stories_search_vector` using ivfflat

- **Edge Function**: `backend-supabase/supabase/functions/payment_and_rewards/index.ts`
  - Handles `payment_webhook` and `daily_checkin` events
  - RPC calls to grant rewards and record payments
  - Minimal JSON parsing with defensive error handling

- **R2 Worker**: `workers/r2-signed-url/worker.js`
  - JWT-based asset access control
  - Role check: `premium` and `admin` bypass VIP gating
  - Cache headers: `private` for VIP, `public` for public assets
  - Signature validation for webhook payloads

- **Embedding Backfill**: `backend-supabase/supabase/scripts/backfill_embeddings.js`
  - Batch embedding generation using OpenAI API (optional)
  - Upserts embeddings via Supabase service role
  - Continues until all rows processed

- **Tests**: `backend-supabase/supabase/tests/`
  - `rls-policies.test.sql`: RLS policy validation
  - `payment_and_rewards.test.ts`: Edge Function handler tests
  - `worker.test.js`: R2 Worker JWT and gating tests

### Cloudflare Workers (R2 Asset Proxy)

- `workers/r2-signed-url/` handles asset gating and caching
- JWT payload includes role for authorization decisions
- Edge-cached responses minimize origin load


## Standard Practices

- New features start as a use case, not as direct route logic.
- Repositories must be injectable and must not leak transport concerns.
- Validate request payloads before business logic executes.
- Use `DomainError` subclasses for known failures.
- Use `GlobalExceptionHandler` or equivalent transport middleware to map errors to safe responses.
- Include a request trace id in every error response.
- Keep code style and naming consistent with the surrounding layer.

## Validation Expectations

- Keep layer imports pointed inward.
- Avoid direct database or storage access outside infrastructure code.
- Prefer small, testable changes over broad refactors.
- Verify new code with the narrowest relevant check before widening scope.
