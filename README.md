## Local Development

```bash
npm --prefix packages/api-types run generate   # Generate TS types from OpenAPI spec
npm --prefix frontend install
npm --prefix frontend run dev                  # Next.js on port 3001

# Workers (each in its own terminal)
npm --prefix workers/api-gateway run dev       # Gateway on port 8787
npm --prefix workers/comics-worker run dev     # Domain workers on separate ports

# Supabase
cd backend-supabase
supabase start                                 # Local Supabase on port 54321
```

## Platform Features

- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based search using pgvector (1536-dimensional embeddings)
- **VIP Content Gating**: Row-level security policies protect premium chapters
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions for live chapter changes
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless webhooks for payments and rewards
- **Asset Proxy**: Cloudflare R2 with JWT + HMAC signed URL access control
- **Role-based Access**: Admin panel for content management (superadmin, admin, employee, user)
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point with JWT validation, rate limiting, and strict CORS

## Runtime Notes

- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables in the browser; keep secrets server-side.
- Internal admin routes live under `/api/internal/admin/*` (being migrated to `/api/v1/*`).
- Workers use service bindings for inter-worker communication (no public DNS between them).
