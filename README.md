  docs/                    # Architecture and release notes
```

## Frontend

Location: `frontend/`

Main scripts:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run ci:verify
```

Environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_publishable_key

# Server-side (do NOT expose these in the browser):
# `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Supabase service_role key used by server internal routes/functions.
# `INTERNAL_ADMIN_SECRET` — short, high-entropy secret to allow trusted internal requests.
```

Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` keys for frontend runtime configuration.

### Authentication & Access

- Sign in with password, Google OAuth, and email magic link.
- User self-registration with email verification.
- Dedicated password reset flow via `/auth/reset-password`.
- Role-based admin access for `superadmin`, `admin`, and `employee` with route guards.
- Admin user-role operations are hardened to prevent unsafe role transitions and self-role edits.

### Admin Operations

- Operations center for core content, user, commerce, analytics, and system workflows.
- Operations data tab to validate backend admin tables and row counts in real time.
- Menu visibility controls for role-based sidebar configuration.
- System settings backup and restore for the settings surface managed in the UI.

### Comic Management (New)

Comic management system with multi-chapter support and Cloudflare R2 image storage:

**Features:**
- Create comics with metadata and cover image upload to R2
- Add chapters with ordered multi-image uploads (1→2→...→end)
- Row-level security enforcing owner-only CRUD operations
- Numeric image ordering UI with move/remove controls
- Dashboard integration with role-based access

**Backend:**
- Tables: `comics` (id, owner_id, title, description, cover_url), `chapters` (id, comic_id, chapter_number, title, content), `chapter_images` (id, chapter_id, image_url)
- RLS policies: owners can only create/modify their own comics and chapters
- Edge functions:
  - `create_comic` — validates bearer token, inserts comic with owner_id set from JWT
  - `upload_to_r2` — handles multi-file uploads to Cloudflare R2, returns public URLs

**Frontend:**
- Pages: `frontend/src/app/comics/create/page.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/comics/[comicId]/add-chapter/page.tsx`
- Dashboard tabs: accessible from admin menu when user has creator role
- Tailwind-styled responsive UI with file preview and drag-reorder support

### Architecture: MVP / Clean Separation

Following **zero-leakage principle**, direct Supabase client calls (`supabase.from()`, `.rpc()`) are strictly prohibited in UI components and client services. Instead:

1. **View Layer** (React components in `src/pages/`, `src/components/`) — handles UI rendering only; calls presenters.
2. **Presenter Layer** (React Query hooks in `src/_presenters/`, `src/hooks/`) — client-side data orchestration; calls server APIs via `fetch()`.
3. **Server API Layer** (`src/app/api/**/*.ts`) — Next.js App Router routes that perform server-side Supabase queries and role verification.
4. **Service Layer** (`src/services/**`) — optional server-side helper services (e.g., `siteMetrics.service.ts`); used by API routes, never imported into components.

**Key files:**
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` — lazy server Supabase client factory (avoids build-time env errors).
- `src/app/api/stories/`, `src/app/api/chapters/`, `src/app/api/rpc/`, `src/app/api/internal/admin/` — public and internal routes (all with role checks and server supabase access).
- `src/_presenters/useOperationsPresenter.ts`, `useAdManagerPresenter.ts` — React Query hooks for admin views.
- `src/services/admin.service.ts` — admin client service that calls internal server routes (not direct supabase).

**Internal Routes** (`src/app/api/internal/admin/**`):
- Accept Bearer token (JWT) or `x-internal-secret` header.
- Perform server-side role/permission checks.
- Use service_role key for sensitive operations.
- Examples: `/api/internal/admin/profiles` (GET/POST), `/api/internal/admin/audit` (GET/POST), `/api/internal/admin/manage-story`, `/api/internal/admin/manage-chapter`, `/api/internal/admin/taxonomy`.

**Public Routes** (`src/app/api/**`):
- RPC wrappers: `/api/rpc/increment-story-views`, `/api/rpc/like-story`, `/api/rpc/unlike-story`.
- Data endpoints: `/api/stories`, `/api/chapters`, `/api/taxonomy/categories`, `/api/site-settings`, `/api/system-settings`, `/api/site-metrics`, `/api/role-distribution`.
- Auth: `/api/auth/verify-recovery`.

**Environmental secrets:**
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-only; used in server routes.
- `INTERNAL_ADMIN_SECRET` — short secret for trusted automation endpoints.

## Backend

Location: `backend-supabase/supabase/`

Contains:

- `migrations/` for versioned SQL
- `functions/` for Edge Functions
- `tests/` for SQL smoke checks
- `config.toml` for local Supabase settings

## Cloudflare SaaS Backend

Location: `backend-d1-saas/`

Contains a standalone Cloudflare Workers backend that provisions one D1 database per tenant and keeps the tenant registry in a control-plane D1 database.

Current baseline migration:

- `backend-supabase/supabase/migrations/202604200001_mvp_init.sql`

Recent operations migration:

- `backend-supabase/supabase/migrations/20260421074259_admin_operations_schema.sql`
  - Adds collections, moderation queue, crawler sources/runs, VIP plans/subscriptions,
    promotions/events, transactions, comments/ratings, and revenue snapshots.

Suggested verification scope:

- `backend-supabase/supabase/tests/rls_smoke.sql`
- `backend-supabase/supabase/tests/rpc_smoke.sql`

## Security & Performance Updates (April 2026)

Recent comprehensive audit identified and resolved 10 critical security, performance, and reliability issues:

### Database & Security (3 items)

1. **RLS Policy Hardening** - Fixed critical "select true" leak on site_settings that exposed ad keys and sensitive config to unauthenticated users. Now requires authentication with restricted "public_*" key access.
2. **View Count Race Condition** - Replaced simple UPDATE with idempotent RPC using story_views tracking table, preventing duplicate increments under high concurrency.
3. **Profile Role Escalation Prevention** - Verified and maintained trigger-based protection preventing unauthorized role changes; only superadmin can modify user roles.

### Frontend Performance (3 items)

4. **Ad Injection Optimization** - Deferred ad script injection using requestIdleCallback (fallback setTimeout) to prevent main thread blocking and improve Lighthouse scores.
5. **Bundle Size Reduction** - Implemented dynamic imports for admin dashboard; non-admin users no longer download admin code (~13KB saved).
6. **Dark Mode FOUC Prevention** - Applied blocking script pattern + useLayoutEffect to eliminate white flash on load by applying theme before React hydrates.

### Error Handling & UX (4 items)

7. **Global Error Handling** - Added useGlobalErrorHandler hook and GlobalErrorHandler component to catch unhandled promise rejections and surface Supabase errors via toast UI.
8. **Chapter Draft Auto-Save** - Implemented useAutoSave hook with 3-second debounced localStorage backup; unsaved work persists across session expiry and tab crashes.
9. **Client-Side RBAC Audit** - Created RLS audit migration verifying all admin tables enforce role-based access; client-side protections are supplementary only.
10. **Optimistic Updates Foundation** - Created useOptimisticUpdate hook enabling snappier UI feedback for likes/views; integration examples in `frontend/src/examples/OptimisticUpdateExample.tsx`.

**Commits**: 935242d, a99a3cf (completed April 28, 2026)

### Usage Notes
- Optimistic updates are ready for integration via `useStoryMutations` hook
- Auto-save recovery automatically triggers on page reload with user notification
- Theme blocking script runs before React initialization; check suppressHydrationWarning in html tag if troubleshooting
- RLS audit migration can be run manually: `SELECT * FROM app_private.check_rls_policies();`


## Local Setup

1. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Run the app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Default dev server runs on `http://localhost:3001`.

You can run this from the repository root with `npm --prefix frontend run dev` or directly inside `frontend/`.

3. Build and type-check the frontend before shipping:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run ci:verify
```

4. If you hit intermittent `500` with missing `.next` artifacts (for example `routes-manifest.json`), reset local cache and restart:

```bash
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
rm -r frontend/.next
npm --prefix frontend run dev
```

## Supabase Sync

Use the Supabase CLI from `backend-supabase/`:

```bash
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
supabase db push
supabase functions deploy increment-story-views
supabase functions deploy manage-story
supabase functions deploy manage-chapter
```

## Deployment & Internal API notes

- The frontend exposes internal server routes under `/api/internal/admin/*` that must be protected in production.
- Set `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `INTERNAL_ADMIN_SECRET` in the deployment environment before enabling admin features.
- Recommended workflow:
  1. Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `INTERNAL_ADMIN_SECRET` to your hosting provider's secret store (Vercel/Netlify/Cloud run env vars).
  2. Ensure only server-side code reads `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`; never surface this key to the browser.
  3. The internal routes support two auth paths:
     - Bearer JWT: client sends `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`; server verifies token and profile role using the service role client.
     - Internal secret: send `x-internal-secret: <INTERNAL_ADMIN_SECRET>` from trusted internal services for automation.
  4. Audit access logs and rotate `INTERNAL_ADMIN_SECRET` regularly.

### Testing internal routes locally

To validate the internal admin endpoints return the expected authorization responses during local development, run the dev server and the included smoke test:

```bash
# from repo root
npm --prefix frontend run dev
# in another shell (no secrets set)
npm --prefix frontend run test:internal-auth
```

If you need to run the smoke test with service-role credentials, set `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in your `.env.local` (do not commit it) and re-run the test to exercise server-side behavior.

### Replacing client Edge Function calls

- The previous client call to the `manage-user` Edge Function has been replaced by a proxied internal endpoint at `/api/internal/admin/manage-user` that performs server-side role checks and calls Supabase admin APIs using the service role key.
- If you deploy the backend Edge Function `manage-user`, it can remain as a fallback for external integrations, but the frontend now prefers the internal route for admin actions.

The linked project in this workspace is `rwnzsmmfvsetfcnkjoxt`.

## CI

The repository uses GitHub Actions to:

- clean Next cache, then run frontend `ci:verify` (type-check + build)
- validate backend file structure
- open an automatic pull request for non-main pushes after CI succeeds

## Notes

- `agents/` is intentionally git-ignored for local project memory.
- Legacy SQL files at the repository root are retained for reference during transition.
